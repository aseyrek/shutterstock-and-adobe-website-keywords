# shutterstock-and-adobe-website-keywords
With this javascript code and a chrome app like "custom javascript for websites 2" you can get keywords from shutterstock and adobe really fast!

Just install Custom javascript for websites:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/ddbjnfjiigjmcpcpkmhogomapikjbjdk?hl=en

Click on its icon and paste the code for whatever website you are on. If you are on shutterstock just paste the shutterstock code.

Sometimes you just need to refresh the page.

I'm open to any suggestions to make it better.

Thank you!
